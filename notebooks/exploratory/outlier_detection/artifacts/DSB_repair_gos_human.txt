MATCH GO:0006281(DNA repair) defn: "The process of restoring DNA after damage. Genomes are subject to damage by chemical and physical agents in the environment (e.g. UV and ionizing radiations, chemical mutagens, fungal and bacterial toxins, etc.) and by free radicals or alkylating agents endogenously generated in metabolism. DNA is also damaged because of errors during its replication. A variety of different DNA repair pathways have been reported that include direct reversal, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, photoreactivation, bypass, double-strand break repair pathway, and mismatch repair pathway."

MATCH GO:0097680(double-strand break repair via classical nonhomologous end joining) defn: "An instance of double-strand break repair via nonhomologous end joining that requires a number of factors important for V(D)J recombination, including the KU70/80 heterodimer (KU), XRCC4, ligase IV, and DNA-PKcs in mammals.

MATCH GO:0097681(double-strand break repair via alternative nonhomologous end joining) defn: "An instance of double-strand break repair via nonhomologous end joining that is independent of factors important for V(D)J recombination (as opposed to classical nonhomologous end joining). It often results in a deletion with microhomology (i.e. 5-25bp homology) at the repair junction. Among different subclasses of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), alternative NHEJ appears to play a significant role in the etiology of mutations that arise during cancer development and treatment."

The broken DNA searches for and base pairs with a homologous region in an intact chromosome. DNA synthesis initiates from the 3' end of the invading DNA strand, using the intact chromosome as the template. Newly synthesized DNA is then displaced from the template and anneal with its complement on the other side of the double-strand break." [PMID:10357855]
