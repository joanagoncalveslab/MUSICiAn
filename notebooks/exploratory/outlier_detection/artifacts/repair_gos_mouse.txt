Genomes are subject to damage by chemical and physical agents in the environment (e.g. UV and ionizing radiations, chemical mutagens, fungal and bacterial toxins, etc.) and by free radicals or alkylating agents endogenously generated in metabolism. DNA is also damaged because of errors during its replication. A variety of different DNA repair pathways have been reported that include direct reversal, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, photoreactivation, bypass, double-strand break repair pathway, and mismatch repair pathway."

MATCH GO:0090262(regulation of transcription-coupled nucleotide-excision repair) defn: "Any process that modulates the frequency, rate, or extent of the nucleotide-excision repair process that carries out preferential repair of DNA lesions on the actively transcribed strand of the DNA duplex. In addition, the transcription-coupled nucleotide-excision repair pathway is required for the recognition and repair of a small subset of lesions that are not recognized by the global genome nucleotide excision repair pathway."

MATCH GO:0010705(meiotic DNA double-strand break processing involved in reciprocal meiotic recombination) defn: "The cell cycle process in which the 5' to 3' exonucleolytic resection of the DNA at the site of the break to form a 3' single-strand DNA overhang occurs resulting in double strand break formation and repair through a double Holliday junction intermediate." [GOC:dph, GOC:tb]
MATCH GO:0006311(meiotic gene conversion) defn: "The cell cycle process in which genetic information is transferred from one helix to another. It often occurs in association with general genetic recombination events, and is believed to be a straightforward consequence of the mechanisms of general recombination and DNA repair. For example, meiosis might yield three copies of the maternal version of an allele and only one copy of the paternal allele, indicating that one of the two copies of the paternal allele has been changed to a copy of the maternal allele."

MATCH GO:0010780(meiotic DNA double-strand break formation involved in reciprocal meiotic recombination) defn: "The cell cycle process in which double-strand breaks are generated at defined hotspots throughout the genome during meiosis I resulting in meiotic recombination. Meiotic recombination is the cell cycle process in which double strand breaks are formed and repaired through a double Holliday junction intermediate." [GOC:dph, GOC:tb]
