# Outline of Article

### Section I - Comparisons with Adamson Dataset
Fig 1
a. Overview of method
b. Profile per target site
c. Estimating the geometric mean of the controls
d. Hierarchical clustering of genes

### Section II - Show MUSICiAn ranks DSB genes at the top
Fig 2. 
a. PR curves vs Hussmann et al and GO DSB genes
b. Top enriched GO Terms
c. Recovery of known pathway genes from KEGG

### Section III - Show associations between individual genes and DSB pathways
Fig 3.
a. Change in frequency relative to psuedo-controls for known DSB genes
b. Change in frequency relative to psuedo-controls for novelly associated DSB genes

### Section IV - Speculate why correlation in changes in frequency is inconsistent for DSB pathways
Fig 4. 
a. Consistency is not affected by psuedo vs real controls
b. Correlation has a wide range across all target sites
c. DSB genes have higher correlation in general between replicates than non-DSB related genes
d. Some genes show more consistency than others, with DSB more located at the top
e. Selection of genes
